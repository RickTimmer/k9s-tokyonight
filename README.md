# k9s-tokyonight
K9s skin to that matches Tokyonight.

As a base for my skin I used [axkirillov/k9s-tokyonight](https://github.com/axkirillov/k9s-tokyonight). I made some minor changes to the palette as well as changed up the styling to match my personal preferences. Styling was mostly chosen based on what color from the palette would be the most similar fit to the stock color.
